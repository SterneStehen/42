START Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let
you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
Your function should return the line that was read.
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when
reading from the standard input.
Please note that the returned line should include the terminating \n character,
except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.
Your header file get_next_line.h must at least contain the prototype of the
get_next_line() function.
Add all the helper functions you need in the get_next_line_utils.c END
